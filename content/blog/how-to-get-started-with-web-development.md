## The Best way to get started with web development
 I'm convinced that in today's world, web development is the best way to get started with programming. It's easy to get started, and you can build a lot of cool things with it. With a good understanding of web development, you can easily transition to other fields of programming. Unlike other fields in software development that require a lot of logical thinking and a strong background in areas like math and algorithms, web development is a lot easier to get started with. You don't need to have a strong background in math or algorithms to get started with web development. You can get started with web development with just a basic understanding of programming fundamentals, and it's more about pattern recognition and memorization. Once you build a few projects, you will start to see patterns and be able to build more complex projects. But how do you get started with web development``for advanced programmers``? In this article, I will show you how to get started with web development as an advanced programmer.

## What is an advanced programmer?
The term ``advanced programmer in this article`` refers to someone who has a good understanding of programming fundamentals and has experience with at least one programming language. If you are a beginner, I recommend you to read my article on `how to get started with programming`.Web development often requires the usage of multiple tools and technologies and people often get confused about where to start and what to learn. For someone that started with Java as my first programming language, I was quickly overwhelmed by the amount of tools and technologies that I had to learn. I had to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, Next.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery, and many more.

## What is the best way to get started with web development?
### concepts to understand:

 *The best way to get started with web development is by understanding these few things:*

    - What is the difference between frontend and backend?
    - What are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
    - What is a web server?
    - What is a database?
    - What is a web framework?
    - What is a web application?
    - What is an API?
    - What is a REST API?
    - What are authentication and authorization?
    - What is web application architecture?
    - What is a web application deployment?

Note: In this article, I will not explain that are all these different elements of web development and how they work together. To make this article short and simple, I will only lay out fundamental concepts. If you want to learn more about each of these elements, I recommend you to read my other articles on web development and check the resources I will provide at the end of this article.

### How to understand these concepts?
To understand these concepts I recommend you work on a lot of projects that cover all these concepts and also read a lot of documentation. I will provide a very good book for people that already have a good understanding of these different concepts and want to move to advanced concepts(in the reactjs ecosystem).
