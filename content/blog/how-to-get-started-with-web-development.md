## The Best way to get started with Web development
 I'm convinced that in today's world, Web development is the best way to get started with programming. It's easy to get started, and you can build a lot of cool things with it. With a good understanding of Web development, you can easily transition to other fields of programming. Unlike other fields in software development that require a lot of logical thinking and a strong background in areas like math and algorithms, Web development is a lot easier to get started with. You don't need to have a strong background in math or algorithms to get started with Web development. You can get started with Web development with just a basic understanding of programming fundamentals, and it's more about pattern recognition and memorization best pratice. Once you build a few projects, you will start to see patterns and be able to build more complex projects. But how do you get started with Web development ``for advanced programmers``? This article will provide an organized approach to getting started with Web development as an advanced programmer.

## What is an advanced programmer?
The term ``advanced programmer in this article`` refers to someone who has a good understanding of programming fundamentals and has experience with at least one programming language. If you are a beginner, I recommend you to read my article on `how to get started with programming`. Web development often requires the usage of multiple tools and technologies and people are generally perplexed about where to begin and what to learn. As someone who began with Java as my first programming language, I was quickly overwhelmed by the number of tools and technologies that I needed to master to build a project from start to finish. I had to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, Next.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery, and many more.

## What is the best way to get started with Web development?
### concepts to understand:

 *The best way to get started with Web development is by understanding these few things:*

    - What is the difference between an Informational Websites and a Web Applications
    - What are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
    - What is a Web application?
    - What is the difference between frontend and backend?
    - What is a Web framework?
    - What is a Web server?
    - What is a database?
    - What is an API?
    - What is a REST API?
    - What are authentication and authorization?
    - What is Web application architecture?
    - What is deployment in Web development?

Note: This article will not go into detail on the many components of Web development and how they interact. To keep this article short and succinct, I only intend to address the fundamentals. If you wish to understand more about each of these elements, I recommend that you look at the resources listed at the end of this article. Please keep in mind that this is a very simplified illustration of a Web development plan based on concepts.

### How to understand these concepts?
To fully understand these principles, I suggest that you work on several projects that cover all of these topics, as well as looking into a lot of documentation. I will suggest a really useful book for folks who already have a strong understanding of these principles, a good experience with Javascript programming language, and want to move on to more complex concepts (in the Reactjs ecosystem).

### Conclusion
Web development is a great way to get started with programming and is very accessible for people that can't find themselves in very niche areas like AI, Machine learning, Data science, etc. Unfortunately, I can't add a lot of detail to this article let me know if you would like further in-depth articles on these various themes. I hope this article will help you get started with Web development and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do. If you have any questions or comments, please leave me an **[email](mailto:devjacques28i@gmail.com)**. I will be happy to answer them.  Thanks for stoping by and have a great day!
